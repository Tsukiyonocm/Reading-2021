## Non-Fiction

1. <b>Punished by Rewards</b> by Alfie Kohn (11 - 29- 19) - Really interesting read about how rewards have a tendency to undermine peoples interest in following through with what the rewards are supposed to increase interest in. This is in regards to parenting, work place incentives, and largely any reward based option. Very fascinating overall and highly recommend it.

2. <b>Archaeology From Space</b> by Sarah Parcak (12-21-19) - Goes into the use of satellites and their usages in helping archaeologist find new sites for further study. The author talks also about the state of looting and how using crowd sourcing platforms they are able to possibly locate new areas of study while trying to get to these locations before the looters. Overall was pretty interesting as the author had plenty of stories from her own adventures, with plenty of Indian Jones references, as well as some times where the information garnered did not prove to be worth while. 

3. <b>A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution</b> by Jennifer Doudna (1-15-20) - Super informative and an all around phenomenal read. I've had a fascination with gene editing since I watched Gattaca years ago. This book goes into detail on the history of gene editing and the emergence of the CRISPR system. It talks about the good things it can possibly do in the future, but, it also talks about the unexpected consequences that could come about because of it as well. Highly recommended to anyone who even has a remote interest in anything about the future of the species and medicine, among other fields of science that can be touched by this technology. 

4. <b>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</b> by Neil DeGrasse Tyson (1-26-20) - A rather quick read compared many others so far, but was quite interesting overall. It gives a brief overview of various topics ranging from dark matter, dark energy, the big bang and many other topics. Its a quick gloss over of the material, but, put in a some what easy to understand knowledge morsel.

5. <b>The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less</b> by Barry Schwartz (3-5-20) - Took me far longer then it should have to read. Was interesting though about the effects the amount of choices in todays world can have on a person. In addition, the last chapter has various tips on how to minimize the effects of those choices on you as well. 

6. <b>Ultralearning</b> by Scott H. Young (4-12-20) - Found this to be a bit interesting. Not the most entertaining to read, but it went over the benefits of learning to an extreme level. For instance, the author learned a new language by basically jumping in day 1 without using English as his primary. Just started speaking the new language, poorly, to the locals and learned from there. Then at night, went over various new words, practiced them and started again the next day. After three months was conversationally fluent anyway and moved on to the next task. If learning is an interest to you, might be worth reading just to see if there are any ways to adapt your own learning with the things read about in this book.

7. <b>Deadliest Enemy</b> by Michael T. Osterholm (5-7-20) - This was very interesting look into the war against virus through the ages. It talks about the history a little bit but also goes into the various struggles with fighting diseases. Talks about Ebola, HIV, Dengue and other mosquito born illnesses, as well as going into bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics. It paints a grim picture of things to come because of the current overuse of antibiotics world wide, largely from animal use in farms for growing purposes. Ultimately it does outline some things that can be done to make sure we do not get into a post antibiotic world and work towards stemming the tide of infections in the process.

8. <b>The Great Influenza</b> by John M. Barry (6-29-20) - A bit slow to get started, the book delves into the modernization of the US medical system to one that uses current science based methods towards medicine. It then delves into how various scientist tried to prevent and cure the Spanish flu as it started. The way the various cities and other public officials dealt with it, how information about the disease was hidden at a time that transparency was required. At the end, it talks about the ramifications of what transpired, how several of the key scientist lives worked out afterwards, and what to do going forward.

9. <b>Bad Blood</b> by John Carreyou (8-12-20) - Was really interested in this once I first heard of it. It basically goes through the history of Theranos and the various perspectives of people who worked there and thought the job was a scam, or at least was not what it was portrayed as. Was fascinating to see how people can be swayed by someone who is good at selling their dreams and are able to get others to believe in what they are saying. Also, listened to her voice on YouTube, just beyond belief that anyone could believe that was her real voice.

10. <b>End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World</b> by Bryan Walsh (9-12-20) - I have been reading some overall dark books over the last couple of months, this is no exception. The author delves into all the ways that humanity can kill itself, or be killed as a whole. Extinction basically. He covers everything from asteroids to aliens, volcanos and nuclear wars, disease and biotechnology and of course, AI. Was an interesting read overall and its very much of interest to hear about the unintended consequences of our choices we make as a society. 

11. <b>When The Earth Had Two Moons</b> by Erik Asphaug (10-15-20) – Ultimately this book covers a lot of information about the creation of the solar system, how the plants and various moons moved as well as the reason to going to various other points in the system to explore. It brings it back into focus though talking about how various methods of the moon’s formation and the Theia theory. All around, was a good book though a bit dense in information.

12. <b>The Revenge of Gaia</b> by James Lovelock (11-11-20) – The basic premise of Gaia theory is that the earth is a self-regulating body in the same sense as any living entity. It tries to maintain a specific temperature via the use of natural means. Ultimately the book goes on to talk about climate change and his personal views on what is needed to help fix the damage we have caused to this system. Its in interesting read, though it does sometimes meander a bit before getting to the point.
