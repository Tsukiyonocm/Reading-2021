## Books read starting December 1st 2021

### Non-Fiction
1. <b>Quiet</b> by Susan Cain (1-10-22) - As an introvert myself, I wanted to read this largely to just read more about myself and why I am the way I am. Also to know that its normal and OK to be what I am and its not something that should be considered broken or in need to be fixed. What I found interesting is that there is different levels that introverts and extroverts can take. While its not a surprise to me that an introvert can come across as an extrovert given the right stimulus, I didn't realize that this can have an effect on someone when done for long term and to extremes. The other thing of interest here is realizing that even though society, at least western society, tends to look down on introverts, like most things, there is a need for balance in the world. Introverts can be every bit as good sellers, artist, musicians as any extrovert can be. Whats largely different between the two is how they can be drained or gain energy between various social situations and quiet time.

2. <b>Typhoid Mary</b> by Anthony Bourdain (1-17-22) - I had been curious about the story of Mary Mallon for awhile. I knew the references to her, someone who is essentially a walking plague, but I really didn't know anything about the person in actuality. After reading this I still don't know a lot about her, but because of this fantastic story, I have a better idea of how she might have felt. He delves into her story from before she was first captured, relays what little of her story is known prior, then delves into the events of what happened. Doing this from a chefs perspective is a good take here because he is able to, likely anyway, put himself in her perspective as a head chef prior to being incarcerated on the island. A proud woman of irish upbringing, with someone barging into her life and flat out saying she is the cause of various typhoid outbreaks which had sickened and killed families that she was employed at. Ultimately relating how in the end, she lost most of her hope and lived till she died after some 25 years or so locked away on the island. All around, its a sad tale and a very humanizing story. Highly recommend the story to everyone.

3. <b>The War On Science</b> by Shawn Otto (4-1-22) - This is a fantastic read! It takes forever though to get through as there is a lot of information to digest here. Firstly, there is no one political spectrum that is at fault, both sides of pushed at various times anti science endeavors. Secondly, it will take a lot of work in order to fix this, but its essential that it gets done. Probably the first step is to stop being so overreactive to people and actually trying to create a dialogue instead of name calling. Talking to people and trying to figure out where their apprehension is towards something can help far more then calling people idiots. Secondly, the realization that science is NOT anti religion. Science is about proving things, religion or god cannot be proved one way or the other, so science as a whole does not really care about it.

4. <b>Chasing Stardust</b> by Natalie Starkey (4-30-22) - This was a more straight forward read. Talked a bit about the origins of the solar system, the current thoughts on where the asteroids and comets were originally created at, as well as the chemical analysis of the comets that leads them to think where they were created. It also delves into some of the missions to visit asteroids and comets and some of the science that has been learned from those missions. Interestingly, it also went into space mining a bit as well, talked about some of the benefits to it, while also delving into some of the many challenges that will need to be overcome as well.

5. <b>The True Believer</b> by Eric Boffer (5-27-22) - Frankly I believe this book was not what I thought it was going to be. While it was a bit interesting, this seems to have gone into the clockwork of how movements get started, the mindset of the type of person who joins one, and how they ultimately fail or succeed. I believe I was more interested in reading about how some of the biggest mass movements in the past got started, more of a history lesson. This came across as more of a psychological study I think. There was things that was interesting to learn though. For instance, the religious and atheist are the same side of the political spectrum, the opposite of a religious zealot is actually someone who has no interest one way or another in a god. So there was bits of interest here for sure, just not what I was interested in.

6. <b>Lifespan</b> by David Sinclair (6-20-22) - This was a fascinating book through and through. First off he goes through and gives a run down on the science and how they learned what they learned. Then he went on and talked about the things that can be done now. The obvious ones that is talked about is exercise and eating properly. While also going into things like using a sauna and a cryothermo tank to bring your body its stress points to relieve pain and introduce healing in general. Lastly, and probably the most interesting part of the book talked about all things being studied now and the possible things coming out in the future. I feel like I could have highlighted almost every page of these chapters and would still be salivating for more information. Overall, highly recommend the book and could even come back and follow up and read this again in the future or at least use it to look up other things for study.

7. <b>How to Raise an Adult</b> by Julie Lythcott-Haims (8-16-22) - The book delved into over-parenting to a degree that I didnt even really realize happened. For instance, parents doing their childrens school work in high school and college so that their child would appear to be succeeding. This is so they either can get into a good college or to help them land that good job after their college life. It delved into the downsides of this, which is largely a person who knows not how to deal with failure or even how to deal with daily problems as they arise in everyday life. In addition, it gives you some advice on how to step back and let your child learn to grow and become and adult, instead of a grown up child. Frankly was an overall great read which I could see myself referencing back to over the years as needed for a reminder on what not to do, and maybe some resources to improve myself as well.

8. <b>Mindset</b> by Carol S. Dweck (9-21-22) - I largely read about this because of it mentioned in some of the previous books I read, including the one right above this. The basics of this is that people can have two types of mindsets, Fixed and Growth. The growth mindset is what you should aim for as it allows you to overcome your adversity and see growth from your errors and mistakes when things don't go your way in life. Whereas the fixed mindset bogs you down with self-doubt if things don't go your way and can largely lead to stagnation. Its a bit more involved than this because people have both mindsets in them at any given time, though they generally involved different aspects of their life. I hopefully can take some of this in order to fix some aspects of my own that I am unhappy with.

9. <b>The Hot Zone</b> by Richard Preston (10-17-22) - A interesting read especially at the beginning of the story. In the beginning it goes into the starting of a Marburg infection and the journey that it likely took with its first main stream infection. The details it goes into on how it reacts inside the body, the blood coming out of the various openings in the body and the eventual explosion, so to speak, of the patient inside the ER was just gruesome. To top it off, this is the more tame version that is similar to Ebola, and Ebola is worse. The rest of the tale once it came over to Reston, Virginia, while interesting, was not as interesting. This was a more modern detective tale and walked you through the events and some of the thoughts that went through the minds of the people involved. All around, gruesome and hope Ebola never becomes airborne and able to transmit like a flu bug.

10. <b>Yes to Life, In Spite of Everything</b> by Viktor Frankl (10-29-22) - This was interesting. The main thing I found interesting is that this guy can have a positive outlook on life after having quite literally lived through the holocaust. Not just that he was alive, he was quite literally an inmate in the concentration camps Theresienstadt, then Auschwitz, and finally Bergen-Belson. While the book was not necessarily what I was hoping it was, it was still a good read. In particular this quote speaking on worldviews and collective guilt:

 > "That worldview that declares an individual guilty because others from the same group to which he happens to belong have actually or allegedly committed some kind of offense? And how ridiculous this outlook seems to us today -- finally! Holding someone to account because of their nationality, native language, or place of birth must seem as ridiculous to us today as making them responsible for their own height.

11. <b>What Unites Us</b> by Dan Rather (11-20-22) - Overall this was a good book. It was a bit of a life story of events that he was involved with, mixed with particular feelings of what he feels unites us as a people. It was interesting hearing about the events he had lived through, his personal viewings of the 60's social and racial changes. Hearing his views of watergate and how its related to peoples reactions to it. I fail at getting anything from the overall story thats memorable in the sense of soundbites perse, but the overall book was quite hopeful I believe and was worth the read regardless.

### Fiction

1. <b>The Living Dead</b> by George Romero and Daniel Kraus (12-19-21) - This was an overall interesting reading experience. The first couple of chapters of this book had me completely deja vu'ed, is that even a word? It had me to the point I had to go back through the last couple of years and order history to make sure I had not already read the book before. After this though, the book diverged and it appears to be a new story I hadn't read before. The story starts off going through different characters and various situations when the zombie apocalypse begins. From here we get to the end of the story where the revelation is quite intriguing if not a little contrived and sort of thrown out there out of the blue. While I agree with the moral here, I think it could have been weeded in the story a bit more, but overall the story was quite good and worth reading.

2. <b>Foundation</b> by Issac Asimov (12-31-21) - This was an interesting read. I had heard about the series for a longtime, and just now decided to finally delve into the first story of it. Basic premise of it is that a top tier mathmatician (psychohistorian in the book) realizes through his equations that society galaxy wide is heading towards a decline which will last several tens of thousands of year. In order to make the fall last longer, he starts a chain of events that is based on the same mathmatics setup to make the decline last only roughly a thousand years. It was interesting reading the deductive reasoning the characters used to make their choices honestly. Through various Seldon Crises, the main protagonist of the several ages talked about here have to deduce the course of events correctly in order to keep society on its path to what should be a golden age. The most interesting take for me from the story though was its take on religion, using it to control a populace in order to forestall any sort of rebellion against them, at least until its worth was no longer needed and it was discarded.

3. <b>The Restaurant at the End of the Galaxy</b> by Douglas Adams (1-16-22) - 6 * 9 = 42

4. <b>Star Wars: Master & Apprentice</b> by Claudia Gray (2-2-22) - So this was a tale about Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. It filled in some of the history on their relationship and overall the character of Qui-gon who sadly was not to fleshed out back in the movies. The tale is ultimately about a coming of age coronation on a planet, some sort of conspiracy, and the events that follow there on. It also filled in a bit more about Count Dooku as well, though not much mind you, it showed a bit more of his decent and ultimate fall from the Jedi. Overall, was a pretty good read all things considered.

5. <b>Harvest Home</b> by Thomas Tryon (3-15-22) - Overall I was not impressed with this book. I believe I had read it was similar to Children of the Corn back before I decided to buy it. I thought the book overall was well written, I just found the overall story somewhat boring. The last couple of chapters were interesting, but not nearly enough to bring this to even a so-so read. The basics is a city family moves to this small middle of nowhere town. Then we slowly get involved with the mythos and mythology of the town and their belief system. It just takes way to long to get going. In likely hood, I will not be reading anything else from this particular author is this is what I have to look forward to.

6. <b>Resident Evil: Underworld</b> by S. D. Perry (3-25-22) - This has the team going into a secret bunker facility in Utah in search of a little black book which has the contact information and contacts for the higher ups inside Umbrella. We get to see some more monsters and get a little information on Trent as well. All around, I got what I expected from this story. Was not the best story of all time, but was interesting enough to fill in more lore in the timeline.

7. <b>Star Wars: The Mandalorian</b> by Joe Schreiber (4-9-22) - Generally when I read a novelization of a movie or tv show, I am usually looking for those things that are not included in the movie. For instance, internal dialogue, extended scenes or just new scenes all together. This did not have any of that. Its basically a scene for scene version of the show and not really any new ground. Not to say it was bad, but just don't have me interested in reading the book for season 2.

8. <b>Come Closer</b> by Sara Grant (4-12-22) - Well this was a pretty quick and interesting read actually. Plays out a bit like Paranormal Experience, but in the first person and without the cameras. While not the most terrifying of reads as I had read, it was quite good watching someones downfall into being possessed by a demon. Probably wont read this again, but I do not regret stumbling across this randomly on facebook.

9. <b>Elder Race</b> by Adrian Tchaikovsky (4-17-22) - This was another book I didn't have much expectation for honestly. I read this only because I liked another of the authors books and got a good deal on a preorder of it. The basic premise behind it is that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. In the story we have the Sorcerer as he becomes known drawn into a quest in order to stop a demon. Its here we find out the sorcerer is actually just someone who was supposed to be watching this lower species of humanoids and just writing reports on them and learning about them, but not interfering. All around this was a quick and interesting read, and honestly leaves me still wanting to read more of the authors other works.

10. <b>Dark Matter</b> by Blake Crouch (4-28-22) - This was fantastic. I went into this not knowing much about it but the name seemed interesting and good reviews from someone I know. The story is very much a multiverse story which plays along the lines of something off Fringe or even the current MCU story arcs. The main character, Jason Dessen, largly an ordinary person is kidnapped one night and what follows is the story of getting back to his family. Though to find out he is sent to a mirror world of his and from there everything goes crazy. The author does a great job of making things fit together and feel confusing at times, leaving you guessing as well as Jason slowly puts the pieces back together. Fantastic and now looking forward to reading more of his work.

11. <b>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</b> by Alan Dean Foster (5-19-22) - I decided I wanted to read the movies books finally. Was going to read all three, but decided to take a break after the second one. That said, I did enjoy the book the same as I enjoyed the movie. While its by no means perfect, the book did a good job of portraying what happened on the screen while building up a little bit that happened either off screen or in the heads of the characters. There was not anything spectacular here thats different, but it wasn't a scene for scene rehash like the Mandalorian book was. All around, enjoyable, but will likely not ever read it again.

12. <b>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</b> by Jason Fry (6-1-22) - All around I still enjoyed this movie and found the book to be a bit better. The book went into the heads a bit of the characters and got nuance that was missed in the movies since its a visual medium. Not to say the story line was perfect, but it did help it a bit in my opinion. Still falls in line though with the previous book in the sense that I will likely never go back to it again in the future.

13. <b>Homeland</b> by R. A. Salvatore (6-13-22) - I have not read this book since I was in high school, probably been at least 22 years. It is still as good now as it was then. Frankly the tales of Drizzt are what got me reading more fiction outside of Star Wars than any other book I have read. Before this series, I had read the Lord of the Rings, and thats basically it. I cant speak more highly of this series and I am looking forward to reading it more. I have many of the books in this line (about 22 I believe as of typing) and I will continue on until I get to the point where I have not read them yet.

14. <b>Resident Evil: Nemesis</b> by S. D. Perry (6-22-22) - This story picked up during the events of Raccoon City that many of the other books have already gone into, though  this time it was dealing with Jill and a new Character Carlos. Overall it was on par with basically the rest of the series, its not going to win awards, but if you enjoy the universe, then it was decent enough. It also filled in some info about Trent as well, which was also a surprise and still curious if that little bit will be more filled in in the future.

15. <b> Planetfall</b> by Emma Newman (7-9-22) - This was sort of a spur of the moment book for me. I had no idea of what I was getting in for, just that the description sounded good. The main character is Ren (short for Renata) who is an engineer. She is part of a group of colonist who left what sounds like a dying Earth for a chance to meet God because of the enlightenment of Suh. The rest of the story starts filling in the blanks of what happens from their first planetfall when they first discovered Gods City to the colony that is now settled today. Honestly, it was a good bit interesting and intriguing. The new bits of info is sprinkled throughout the story just enough to keep you wondering until the end when everything comes together. All around, was a good book, might look into the other books in the series as well just out of curiosity.

16. <b>The Expanse: Leviathan Falls</b> by James S. A. Corey (8-6-22) - Fantastic finale to the series. didn't end the way that I expected, but it was still a satisfactory ending. Of note from the story: "I absolutely believe that people are more good on balance than bad. All the wars and all of the cruelty and all of the violence. I'm not looking away from any of that, and I still think there's something beautiful about being what we are. History is soaked in blood. The future probably will be too. But for every atrocity, there's a thousand small kindnesses that no one noticed. A hundred people who spent their lives loving and caring for each other. A few moments of real grace. Maybe it's only a little more good than bad in us, but.."

17. <b>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back: From a Certain Point of View</b> by Assorted Authors (9-4-22) - I enjoyed this for much the same reason I liked the first one. The stories show that in this vast world there are other people involved that have their own tales going on as well. Not all of the stories were great, some were average at best, but it fleshed out the world. And to be honest, most of us live completely mundane lives that would fit here as well. I really enjoyed the bits about the bounty hunters here as most of them there has not been a ton written about, at least nothing that is still valid anyway. Still overall, the stories were interesting but its not likely something I would come back to read again in the future.

18. <b>All Systems Red</b> by Martha Wells (9-9-22) - This was a short and fun read, wasnt anything super special to me but I did like it. Basically is just written from the perspective of a robot who is tasked as a security bot for a research group. Its generally its own thoughts and how much it would rather be watching TV shows and not having to deal with the humans directly. I am not sure yet if I will continue the series, it was interesting but not much endeared it to me, so time will tell.

19. <b>Age of Ash</b> by Daniel Abraham (10-19-22) - I largely read this because the author is one of the authors of The Expanse, which was just fantastic. This was more of a standard fantasy world but overall it wasnt that bad. I am not sure yet if I liked it enough to read the subsequent stories that will be written since this is expected to be a trilogy, but it was ok. Basic story is a girl named Alys, loses her brother and pretty much just tries to make her life just like his. There is a subplot going in the background naturally, but the basics of the story revolve around Alys and how she changes over the course of a year or so in which the story takes place.

20. <b>Resident Evil: Code Veronica</b> by S. D. Perry (11-09-22) - I never really played the game that this story is based on. This one seems a bit more mystical then the previous entries in the series, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit honestly. I hope they remake the game at some point so I can play through it and see how similar it is to the overall story. Got to feel a bit more for Claire and understanding that all these events happened to someone who has just basically gotten to college age. Mix in some of the usual Umbrella maniacs and a bit of over powered psychic abilities, and a bit of split personalities, and you get a fun story. All around probably one of the better entries into the story in my opinion anyway.

21. <b>Canticle</b> by R. A. Salvatore (11-22-22) - Another fantastic series from Salvatore. I have liked basically everything I have read by him, I really should look into his other works outside of Star Wars and Forgotten Realms. Basically, this story follows Cadderly and a curse that breaks out in the Edificant Library. Without giving much away, the characters are all loveable, and there are various characters from the Drizzt line of stories as well. Most importantly Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder. I really look forward to following up with this series in the future.
