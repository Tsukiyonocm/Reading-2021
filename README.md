### Non-Fiction

1. <b>Mengele: Unmasking the Angel of Death</b> by David G. Marwell (12-24-24) - The author of the book was actually involved with the hunt for Josef Mengele back in the 80's when they were trying to figure out if he was dead or not. Overall the book is broken into two parts, the first part is about the early history up to and including World War 2. This part is quite interesting going into his academic achievements prior to joining the army. You read about how he did end up joining the war and was a glorified medic in the army for many years before his connections was able to get him into the head position at Auschwitz. Here the book is quick to point out that some of the worst things said about Mengele is largely fairy tale in the sense that there is no verifiable evidence that some of them happened. That said, there does look to be ample evidence into his work with twins and verifying what happened to them as they both died at same time. The second half of the book focuses on his run from Germany and life in South America while in hiding and ultmately the search for him and trying to prove his death. Overall, the book was fascinating though the chapters that details the events after what ultimately happened after his death was a bit slow and not as interesting. That said, the final chapter talking about the first and probably only meeting between Josef and his son Rolf. Here we see that Josef was unrepentant and refused to see how everything he did was a bad thing. Lastly, just how someone was able to coldly look thru the groups of people and see not a person, but without any emotion choose thousands for immediate death.
