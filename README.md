### Non-Fiction

1. <b>Digital Minimalism</b> by Cal Newport (1-9-24) - Overall this wasn't quite what I was hoping for. I am not sure what I was looking for to be honest, but this was basically just a book on not spending so much time on social media largely. The book did slightly go over spending time on other websites and just in general not spending much time on your phone, but otherwise it didn't add much I had not already read elsewhere. I think I was looking more into things that can be done to help minimalism in general, sort of like scanning physical images and storing digitally, or storing digital paperwork type of things. Sadly not quite what was received.

2. <b>AI 2041: Ten Visions of Our Future</b> by Kai-fu Lee and Chen Qiufan (3-12-24) - So this was a mixed bag of what I thought I was going to get and what I got. I had assumed this would be more of a deep dive into AI but sadly the book largely skimmed the surface of it. That said, I still found it enjoyable to read and it told me a lot of things on the horizon that I was not familiar with. The book covered AI teaching, driving, UBI, AI happiness, AI bring about plenitude and much more. Overall the Plentitude chapters and AI Teaching was probably the most interesting. The AI teaching is either separate or in addition to a live teacher where the class content is customized for the student based on their strengths, weakness and what they are interested in. Plenitude is about the coming where AI is able to drive down the costs of commodities down to near zero because of the ease of manufacture and the lower cost in general for everything. Overall the book made everything seem all shiny and new and while I doubt it will go as smoothly as portrayed, I sure hope it keeps this course either way.

3. <b>Get Well Soon: History's Worst Plagues and the Heroes Who Faught Them</b> by Jennifer Wright (3-19-24) - This was an interesting read. It basically looked at some of the worst plagues from history. Some of which it went into was Polio, Small Pox, Bubonic Plague and Leprosy among others. Overall the book did not go much in-depth of any of these diseases as a whole, but it did dive into how the populace and leadership in some cases reacted to the outbreaks, as well as how those infected were treated as well. There is a wide range of how people were treated throughout history among which those with Leprosy on Hawaii for instance were removed from the populace and isolated alone on an island. This island eventually become home to hundreds of lepers over time and spoke about how a priest came over to eventually treat these people as humans again. Overall was a good read for an introduction to the various diseases, but by no means is the reading extensive.

4. <b>The Anatomy of Fascism</b> by Robert O. Paxton (5-16-24) - Overall this was an interesting read. It largely went into the history of Fascism, or more precisely the ideas that originated the ideas anyway. It also delved into the failed experiments on where fascism failed to take hold and the thoughts on why it succeeded where it did. It also went into how it could still happen today as the ideas it was based upon have not really gone away, though the likelihood of this managing to garner the same level of success as it did in the 1930's is not likely to happen. The book was not the most interesting of reads honestly, this was more of a education book more so then it was a good tale being told, but it was interesting to see a side that is not often portrayed. I thing for thought is that its not the despot that creates fascism in a society but a set of factors that lead that society to get to that point. If at the end of the day the leader is just a terrible person, you might have a dictatorship, but that does not mean they are fascist.

5. <b>How to Clone a Mammoth</b> by Beth Shapiro (6-13-24) - This was a fascinating read and its right in my wheel house of interests that I don't read enough about, Gene Editing. The book has a hook right at the beginning, she tells you that they will never clone the mammoth. Then they proceed to tell you about the science and how they will go about cloning a simulacrum of the mammoth. The basics of the story is that because of the degradation that happens to DNA over time and especially after anything dies, there is just not enough DNA to fully put together a 100% accurate mammoth. That said, they could in fact use the strands they have and insert that into another elephant and create a likeness of the mammoth. Or even using gene slicing to create new strands of DNA that make another species of elephant have properties of what made a mammoth a mammoth. Highly recommend this book and fantastic look into the world of gene editing and de extinction.

6. <b>I Stooged to Conquer: The Autobiography of the Leader of the Three Stooges</b> by Moe Howard (6-18-24) - I was unsure of what to think going into this book. I am a huge fan of the stooges though and I should have read this a long time ago. Was a fantastic read that takes us through Moe's memories from being a kid up through his death. The way its written I can hear it with his voice as the writing just comes off the way I remember him speaking in the shorts. The only other book I have ever been able to do this with was Typhoid Mary written by Anthony Bourdain. If a fan of the stooges, this will give you some of the insides to the life of the family, the hardships that was faced and the ups and downs through the years. There are a bit of chuckles to be had along the way as well. There are plenty of pictures of everyone through the years, both from the shorts and personal photos. Just fantastic.

7. <b>Beyond Band of Brothers</b> by Major Dick Winters (7-6-24) - Ever since I first watched Band of Brothers many years ago I have felt it was a fantastic show. Somehow though, I did not realize until more recently that it was based off books written by some of the troops that was involved. Primarily off the diary and writings from Dick Winters who led Easy Company and the rest of the Battalion from the outset of the war. If you have seen the show, this follows the events fairly closely but gives a bit more insight from his personal perspective of happenings. It follows the events from Normandy to Holland to Bastiogne and so forth. It did not go into much detail of the events from their coming across the concentration camp, which I was a bit disappointed by, but overall was a fascinating book reading about events from the perspective of someone who was there.

8. <b>A Brave Black Regiment</b> by Captain Luis F. Emilio (8-11-24) - So this was and wasn't what I was looking for. This book also taught me a few things I was not aware of. From the get go, I have always liked the movie "Glory". This movie dictates the events of the 54th Massachusetts in the Civil war and chronicles their formation to the events of Fort Wagner. I have always wanted to learn more about this events so I figured I would buy a book and read about it. I settled on this book. Foremost, I should have read a bit more about the book before buying as its not so much a researched story as it sort of comes across as a officers report to the higher command at the end of the war. In fact, the author was in fact an office of the division and we are getting first hand knowledge of what happened to the regiment during the war. Another thing I did not realize is the events of "Glory" are basically the first days of the regiment in action. The regiment was in action for about 26 months, a bit over two years, Fort Wagner was I believe within their first 4 months of deployment. Overall was interesting, but I was not expecting it to be the sort of dry read as it was. Overall, interesting, but will likely not read it again.

9. <b>How to Build a Dinosaur<b> by Jack Horner (8-11-24) - I was recommended this book by a good friend of mine who is big into dinosaurs and also because of my interest in reading "How to Clone a Mammoth" read earlier in the year. This delves into the genetics again but does so in a way as sort of reverse engineering a dinosaur. For instance, take a chicken egg, using the hormones during development you could make it so that the teeth grow in to the beak, or you could make it no longer have feathers, or a longer snout, or a tail. Its not so much about creating an actual dinosaur as it is creating and finding out the mechanisms that were in place to to originally create these features and triggering them to recreate these features that evolution has since removed. OVerall was quite interesting read and really enjoy the bits about the sciences merging together to create a more full picture of evolution and all the possibilities of what this new info could help with in the future.

10. <b>A Rough Ride to the Future</b> by James Lovelock (8-21-24) - At this point I believe I have read 3 or 4 books from this author. His theory of Gaia basically dictates that the planet is self sustaining and wants to create a static environment for life on it. This book delves a bit into the authors thoughts on Climate Change, in particular how he agrees that climate change is real, but that perhaps its not as big of an issue as its being made out to be. He states that this is largely because the models they are using to predict the future climate do not take into account all the factors that can help control the environment in one way or the other. The primary one the author goes into is the effect of the oceans on the entirety of the Earth climate. Largely that it can serve as a cooling factor for the planet and help slow the effects of the heating. He is also a big proponent of Nuclear energy as well which I always find fascinating to read about as I am not to knowledgeable on it. All around is an interesting read and would highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to learn more about the science of climate change from someone who is not really a denier, but someone who has a more cautioned view of it all.

11. <b>The Fourth Turning</b> by William Strauss (10-28-24) - This was an interesting read for sure though I am not to sure how much I am able to believe. It seems to want to apply an overriding ideal across the entirety of a generation. Largely the book is looking forward into the time frame we currently find ourselves now, though we are likely at the end of the cycle now. We currently find ourselves in what the author calls the fourth turning. Previous fourth turnings include the times of World War 2, the Civil War, as well as the Revolutionary War. The book stats that at the end of this turning, this cycle, we should be heading into a golden age where humanity takes a bit of a leap forward. It remains to be seen, but was for sure interesting. There is a second book that delves into the fourth turning as things have turned out, not sure I will read it, but I might look a bit into it. 


12. <b>Irrationally Predictable</b> by Dan Ariely (11-14-24) - Overall this was a fairly fascinating read. Among th precepts its talking about is that you can predict the irrational choices that the human mind will make. For instance, one of the thought experiments they mentioned is this, say you are in a store that has a pen you have been planning to buy for 20 dollars. Across town though this same pen is on sale at another store for 7 dollars off. Naturally you would head over to buy the pen for the cheaper price. Now though, you are buying a 500 dollar suit, across town though, that same suit can be bought for 7 dollars off. Would you go across town to buy that as well? Most everyone would not, its the same amount of savings, both are saving 7 dollars. This is part of the irrational behavior that sets us apart. The book also talked about how people will take a worse item because its free rather then spending even a 10 cents for a much better quality piece of candy. This was a quite interesting read all through it where the author went through the various experiments they used to come to their conclusions. Highly recommend this.

### Fiction

1. <b>Diabolique</b> by John Paul Fitch (12-16-23) - Ultimately I was not overly impressed with this book. This is basically a book of horror short stories with various themes. Most of the stories had some intriguing parts but overall fell flat to me. Some of the monsters seemed interesting in themselves, but as mentioned the rest of the story just fell apart for me personally cause I found it hard to follow the primary storyteller. Overall, don't regret reading it, but its not something I could recommend and would likely not read again.

2. <b>The Memory Police</b> by Yoko Ogawa (1-13-24) - This was a surprise and I found it somewhat enjoyable though quite different then anything I have probably read before. The basic premise is that the main character and the people who live on this island (somewhere around Japan), live a perfectly normal every day existence. The largest difference is that every now and again things disappears. What this means is that, say while you are sleeping, as this always seems to happen overnight, picture frames disappear. When you wake up in the morning, something feels off about your head, you see these things on your dresser but have no idea what they are. Eventually you realize they were things to hold pictures in but have no idea what they are called. Then you are required to remove them all from your house and dispose of them and never have them again. This is enforce by a sort of Nazi like storm trooper type unit call Memory Police. All around a fun read.

3. <b>Sojourn</b> by R. A. Salvatore (1-29-24) - I believe I wrote it in the previous thoughts on these books, this series is just stunning and so glad I am re-reading it all these years later. This one takes Drizzt out of the Underdark and into the over world as he starts on the journey that he is well known for. Spectacular story, great characters and just the write mix of wit and emotion mixed in. Again the monologues of Drizzt are just spectacular and some of the best bits of the overall story. Frankly I feel I could write this for almost every book in the series that I have at least personally read.

4. <b>Star Wars: Queens Shadow</b> by E. K. Johnston (2-14-24) - This book took place in the interim periods of episode 1 and episode 2. The story starts largely on Amidala's last couple of days of being queen and goes into the first year or so of being a senator for Naboo. Overall was interesting to see the interactions between the various senators and her. For a story that largely did not have much going on with it, I still found it interesting to read as it filled in the world a bit more.

5. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - Midnight Horizon</b> (3-24-24) - So this story actually takes place concurrently with the last High Republic story I read called "The Fallen Star". This story though takes place on Corellia where there is a Nihil plot being uncovered. In the course of events the story is unwound and we have to see things from the perspectives of the Jedi who are on Corellia and can feel the events going on back on Starlight Beacon where their friends are dying. All around was a pretty decent read, was sort of interesting seeing things play out from a different perspective and them having to contend with their feelings and wanting to run immediately to try to save their friends back on the station. 

6. <b>Upgrade</b> by Blake Crouch (4-12-24) - Overall this was a good story. It was not as good as Dark Matter or Recursion, but it was enjoyable. My main complaint was that it took about 2/3rds of the book to get moving and the conclusion was basically the last like 50 pages of it. The pacing just seemed a bit off. That said, the basis of the story was quite nice and it covered a topic that I have an interest in even if that some of things that happen aren't exactly likely to happen in the world any time soon. The basics of the story is that because of a very bad event in years passed, genetic editing is banned and illegal. Naturally something is introduced which converts the primary players into what amounts to almost a super hero, though not in the sense of Marvel or DC anyway. Well worth the read overall, just not on par with the aforementioned books

7. <b>A Thousand Pieces of You</b> by Claudia Gray (5-1-24) - Overall this story was a bit predictable but the characters and the settings were written well enough that I didn't care much. I enjoyed the story quite a bit. Do I like it enough to complete the series? I am not sure yet, but I do not regret reading the story. Overall the story is fairly basic, the main characters father gets murdered in the beginning, main character and the family friend decide to use the parents tech to go through other dimensions to capture the killer and get revenge. OVerall thats about the extent of it. The settings all felt different but the same at the same time and like I said, I enjoyed the story for what it was. This author has a way of capturing my attention with liking the characters and just enjoying the overall story.

8. <b>The Witcher: The Tower of Swallows</b> by Andrezej Sapkowski (6-24-24) - The last couple of books in The Witcher series, while good, have been sort of odd. I get through reading them and I almost feel like not much has happened. Ive enjoyed the lore and I have enjoyed the tale regardless, but it sort of just reminds me of various aspects of the Lord of the Rings where nothing happened outside of the people walking to a destination. This story gave us a much more in-depth story on what happened with Ciri, went a bit into what's going on with Yennefer, and we got the Geralt himself doing his things and slaying people all over. Overall as stated, I like the story and I am intrigued to see how the overall story arc starts winding down to its conclusion. Especially with Ciri as she seems to have become wicked a bit over the time away from the main crew and on her own.

9. <b>We Are Here to Hurt Each Other</b> by Paula D Ashe (7-2-24) - This was a strange read. I bought this on a whim largely because of the cover looked interesting to me. I had thought it was an actual story, but it ended up being some sadistic short stories that involved a lot of people being brutalized in some way. It was somewhat interesting on the whole, but was just not expecting it. Not sure I would read more from the author? Overall I just didn't really feel connected to the stories, but they were brutal to say the least. In various ways people were getting ripped apart and just cut to pieces, getting their faces blown off with shotguns. Was just all over the place.

10. <b>The Crystal Shard</b> by R. A. Salvatore (8-6-24) - What else needs to be said about this book? While I originally read the Dark Elf books in chronological order, this is truly the book that started the series. Largely pits the main players against a wayward wizard who gets his hands on the Crystal Shard. Being controlled by the crystal largely he created an army to take over Ten Towns. Then the adventure begins. A great read and loving to have reread this for the first time since I was in high school, which at this point was first done back about 23 years or so ago. 

11. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - Path of Deceit</b> by Tessa Gratton and Justina Ireland (8-22-24) - I was sort of surprised by this read. Overall this was a descent read, but I was expecting it to be more related to the overall story arc of the rest of the High Republic books. This book had nothing to do with Nihil at all and instead focus on a Force Cult that has been stealing artifacts. I did enjoy everything about the story and there will be a continuation of it based on the ending and sort of looking forward to seeing where this is going.

12. <b>Cadaver: Book 1</b> by Nick Clause (8-27-24) - So this was bought on a whim largely just cause I like zombies and the book was at the right price. I was pleasantly surprised. The book started off slow honestly and I really wasn't feeling it, but about 4th of the way through the story I started to enjoy it a lot more. The basics are that some kids find a body hanging in the woods in a cabin. They cut the person down and put in their car to take back to town. Once the zombie thaws is when the natural happens. So this we get to see the more or less start of the zombie virus coming into effect. I did enjoy this enough that I will probably by the next book in the series at some point and continue the story and see how it goes.

13. <b>Nier Automata: Short Story Long</b> by Jun Eishima (9-3-24) - So needless to say I love this game and I love the music associated with the games and just the universe in general. I only just found out about the books a few weeks ago and knew I had to give them a shot. I picked up this one as it was the first one released. Taking place at various points before, during and after the story of the game, it covers aspects of Emil, A2, and also backgrounds of 2B and 9S. Overall it was an interesting read and I especially loved the stories about 2B and Emil. Overall this gives me great hope about the rest of the books and I look forward to having a chance to read those in the future as well. 

14. <b>Forgotten Realms: Spellfire</b> by Ed Greenwood (9-29-24) - I have not jumped much outside of the R.A Salvatore books when reading into the forgotten realms. I am really hoping to branch out more as for the most part, what I have read has been amazing. This title puts the main character as Shandril Shessair, she is largely just a woman who gets put in an impossible situation and comes out the better for it. She gets a gift that turns out the be largely genetic to her activated during a fight. This sets off a larger chain of events of evil upon evil seeking to capture or kill her. While not being as good as the Drizzt books I have read, the characters are intersting enough to keep me engaged even if the battles are not as well choreographed as the aforementioned books. All this taken into account, I will for sure be reading more in the future.

15. <b>Star Wars: Death Star</b> by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry (11-4-24) - This book takes place in the legends line of books now and is not really canon to the current movies. That said, it was still interesting story, filled in some of the back story that was originally told about the Death Stars creation and also introduced some new characters into the mix which were overall pretty interesting. The story ultimately aligned with the original movie and you can see some of the various scenes line for line playing out. It was interesting seeing how these played a part in the overall arc of the story. All around was an interesting read and sort of surprised I never read it in the past.
