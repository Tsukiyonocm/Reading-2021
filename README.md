### Non-Fiction
1. <b>Quiet</b> by Susan Cain (1-10-22) - As an introvert myself, I wanted to read this largely to just read more about myself and why I am the way I am. Also to know that its normal and OK to be what I am and its not something that should be considered. What I found interesting is that there is different levels that introverts and extroverts can take. While its not a surprise to me that an introvert can come across as an extrovert given the right stimulus, I didn't realize that this can have an effect on someone when done for long term and to extremes. The other thing of interest here is realizing that even though society, at least western society, tends to look down on introverts, like most things, there is a need for balance in the world. Introverts can be every bit as good sellers, artist, musicians as any extrovert can be. Whats largely different between the two is how they can be drained or gain energy between various social situations and quiet time.

2. <b>Typhoid Mary</b> by Anthony Bourdain (1-17-22) - I had been curious about the story of Mary Mallon for awhile. I knew the references to her, someone who is essentially a walking plague, but I really didn't know anything about the person in actuality. After reading this I still don't know a lot about her, but because of this fantastic story, I have a better idea of how she might have felt. He delves into her story from before she was first captured, relays what little of her story is known prior, then delves into the events of what happened. Doing this from a chefs perspective is a good take here because he is able to, likely anyway, put himself in her perspective as a head chef prior to being incarcerated on the island. A proud woman of irish upbringing, with someone barging into her life and flat out saying she is the cause of various typhoid outbreaks which had sickened and killed families that she was employed at. Ultimately relating how in the end, she lost most of her hope and lived till she died after some 25 years or so locked away on the island. All around, its a sad tale and a very humanizing story. Highly recommend the story to everyone.


### Fiction

1. <b>The Living Dead</b> by George Romero and Daniel Kraus (12-19-21) - This was an overall interesting reading experience. The first couple of chapters of this book had me completely deja vu'ed, is that even a word? It had me to the point I had to go back through the last couple of years and order history to make sure I had not already read the book before. After this though, the book diverged and it appears to be a new story I hadn't read before. The story starts off going through different characters and various situations when the zombie apocalypse begins. From here we get to the end of the story where the revelation is quite intriguing if not a little contrived and sort of thrown out there out of the blue. While I agree with the moral here, I think it could have been weeded in the story a bit more, but overall the story was quite good and worth reading.

2. <b>Foundation</b> by Issac Asimov (12-31-21) - This was an interesting read. I had heard about the series for a longtime, and just now decided to finally delve into the first story of it. Basic premise of it is that a top tier mathmatician (psychohistorian in the book) realizes through his equations that society galaxy wide is heading towards a decline which will last several tens of thousands of year. In order to make the fall last longer, he starts a chain of events that is based on the same mathmatics setup to make the decline last only roughly a thousand years. It was interesting reading the deductive reasoning the characters used to make their choices honestly. Through various Seldon Crises, the main protaganist of the several ages talked about here have to deduce the course of events correctly in order to keep society on its path to what should be a golden age. The most interesting take for me from the story though was its take on religion, using it to control a populace in order to forestall any sort of rebellion against them, at least untill its worth was no longer needed and it was discarded.

3. <b>The Restaurant at the End of the Galaxy</b> by Douglas Adams (1-16-22) - 6 * 9 = 42

4. <b>Star Wars: Master & Apprentice</b> by Claudia Gray (2-2-22) - So this was a tale about Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. It filled in some of the history on their relationship and overall the character of Qui-gon who sadly was not to fleshed out back in the movies. The tale is ultimately about a coming of age coronation on a planet, some sort of conspiracy, and the events that follow there on. It also filled in a bit more about Count Dooku as well, though not much mind you, it showed a bit more of his decent and ultimate fall from the Jedi. Overall, was a pretty good read all things considered.
