### Non-Fiction
1. <b>Japans Infamous Unit 731</b> by Hal Gold (12-16-22) - This was more inline with what I was hoping the book on the Nazi doctors I read last year was. This went more into what was done, more about the particular experiments and had a lot more first hand accounts for people who partook or witnessed some of the experiments. I still believe that the Nazi doctors appear to be more cruel, but frankly thats because their work just largely seemed to have no pertinence to actual science and the japanese work at least was science, albeit just very brutal and unethical to the extreme. Overall, WW2 seems like a very dark period in regards to medicine and human ethics.

2. <b>The Planets</b> by Andrew Cohen and Professor Bryan Cox (1-21-23) - This has been something I have been reading at bed time with Aydan for the better part of the last year or so, we just finally finished it. Overall the book was quite informative, going over the creation of the solar system and the planets, going into detail about each of the planets and their place in the system and how things got to be where they are today. Talking about how little we still know about the outer planets of Uranus and Neptune and how we have not been back to them since the Voyager probes of the 70s or 80s. A lot of facts, a lot of things to remember, and spaced over a very long time, but was worth the read for sure. Not something I will likely ever read again though, but I dont regret the reading for a moment.

3. <b>Humankind</b> by Rutger Bregman (2-2-23) - This was a fantastic read. I personally have always felt that I believed that humans are by default selfish. I always loved hearing about those people that do good things. Feel good stories for me get into the heart strings very easily, but I also felt this was a rarity more then the norm. After reading this book, I believe I may be mistaken, that people are not inherently garbage and that there is good in the whole. I also find it interesting that the final chapter of this book goes over the Christmas Truce from World War 1, which is actually the topic of the next book I am going to read. I also am reminded of a passage from the final Expanse book. In which Holden is talking about how humanity is capable of terrible things, but that in the end, the good things we do outnumber the bad, even if just a little. I hope that this is the world that we live in, and I shall try to keep this mindset in the future more and change my way of thinking and maybe interactions with others.

4. <b>The True Story of the Christmas Truce</b> by Anthony Richards (2/19/22) - So I had been planning on reading about this event since I listened to the song by Sabbaton, The Christmas Truce. Then the last book I read prior to this also went into the events that transpired back in WW1. Frankly it was as its written, a large portion of the armies in this particular area of France decided to take off the days of and sometimes much later than Christmas 1914. Usually this was put into place because they wanted to celebrate and spent time burying those who had died on the days and weeks prior in no mans land, but sometimes this continued because everyone felt the need to not ruin a good thing. Often times things would end and go back to war as usual once the next regiment got shifted in. All around a quite impressive feat to have happened in the middle of wartime.

5. <b>The Minimalist Home</b> by Joshua Becker (3/23/23) - So this is just simple book about owning less about the authors best ideas for tackling your whole house. Ultimately I read this because the topic interest me and I find myself at least moving this way for the future. Not to say I am going to go down to 30 belongings or anything, but I have been trying to overall buy less and get rid of some of the stuff I owned myself anyway. Overall the book was informative, though nothing revolutionary if you have read on the topic in the past.

6. <b>The Vanishing Face of Gaia</b> by James Lovelock (4-21-22) - So the main premise of the book and James Lovelock in general is the Gaia Theory, to my understanding, the theory stands that the earth itself is capable of controlling its own climate as a human body does to keep it in homeostasis for life. Like a human being getting sick though, eventually so much can be dumped into it that you catch a cold. The world adjust to this as much as it can, but eventually it becomes to much and much of its life force can be killed off and a new normal begins. This particular book I was interested in because he is a big proponent of nuclear energy which I perosnally am not to familiar with the pros and cons of it. He is not so much a fan of the other renewables though such as wind, solar (except solar thermal), and hydro. The main complaint is that those are sort of a using a bandaid to heal a gunshot wound, they do little more then offer platitudes and really dont solve the problem at large. Was a fascinating book for sure, though I feel this quote is probably the most interesting: <br>
<i>"In fifty years in the whole worldwide nuclear industry no more than one hundred have died. Compare this with the tens of thousands who died in the coal and oil industries and the hundreds of thousands who died in making renewable energy or from the consequences of using it. Yes, hydroelectricity is “renewable,” but who notices how dangerous it is until a dam bursts?"</i>

7. <b>This is not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality</b> by Peter Pomerantsev (5/19/23) - This was another book where it was not exactly what I was expecting, but was another happy read. Well happy in the sense that I found it interesting anyway of a read. Overall the book focused a lot on the Russian troll farms where they are hired specifically to push an agenda throughout the website. If the Kremlin wanted to push for a particular policy or to push for a specific outcome of confusion or discord, they would flood the internet and various news sites comment boards with comments in order to push a divide. He talked a bit also about the good the internet has had in regards to allowing people to being able to find like minded individuals to create a movement for change. Then like in black mirror talks about how that same thing has been used to put despots in power, murder countless innocent and overall just pushing people to act as a mob. Overall a scary look into the future, but a hopeful one somewhat to hope that this will pass.

### Fiction
1. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - The Rising Storm</b> by Cavan Scott (12-14-22) - This has been a surprisingly good story arc so far I think. The series seems to do some things different then other book series in the sense that a large portion of the book seems to take place over a couple of hours of time. This is in contrast where many other stories just seems to pass on for months at a time. In this case the main part of the story follows another of the "Great Works" to bring unity to the republic, in this case its a great fair. Naturally this doesn't go to plan and things get interrupted by the Nihil. That with the more human feeling Jedi in the story arc as a whole has me interested in following up. I might even have to pay full price for the rest of the stories.

2. <b>Patron Tales</b> by Russell Smeaton  (12-16-22) - This was a mixed bag of stories which is a mixture of dark fantasy and just plain odd. Probably my favorite story was the Etch-a-sketch story which just seemed quite cool honestly. A bit of a mystery and a pleasant ending that was not quite what I would have suspected. Another story called "Sandcastle" seems like the prologue to a dark Narnia story or something. Seems to me it could have leapt into a much larger world. Overall, the stories were mixed with various frogs, chickens, and a bunch (or one?) cat!

3. <b>The Expanse: Memories Legion</b> by James S. A. Corey (1/9/23) - Finishing the series out by reading the book that contains all the short stories that was written thru the run of the main series. Filling in some of the back stories of Amos, Erich, and Solomon Epstein among many others. Was a fantastic read and the final story was sort of a nice ending to the series. I really hope they fill in the universe again at some point, but I believe this may be it. Honestly do not regret reading a single story in this series as a whole.

4. <b>The Witcher: Baptism of Fire</b> by Andrzej Sapkowski (2/13/23) - Overall this sort of felt like it was more of a filler episode of a show more so then the main story. It seems to be setting up the narrative for the future books as it didnt really delve to much outside of setting up a few events and have a lot of character development. We get a bit of what happened to Yennefer, Geralt and Ciri after the events of the last book and the battle at the magic island, but we dont really learn much more then that, especially with Ciri. It was still interesting getting to know some more characters, I just wish there would have a been a bit more meat to the story.

5. <b>Recursion</b> by Blake Crouch (2/21/23) - Blake Crouch is easily becoming one of my favorite authors. Everything I have read by him has been pure gold, and this is no exception. Think of a chair that can take you back to any memory largely of your choice, you could go back in time and relive your life starting from a particular moment full memories intact and change events that you did not like in your life. The downside is, once you get back to the moment in time you choose to go back in time, everyone now has a second set of memories of this previous life as well as the memories of the current life. So if you died in the first life but were saved in the second, you now have the memories of dying. Wash rinse repeat and abuse and you have the basis for this story. Fantastic.

6. <b>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</b> by Seth Dickinson (3/24/23) - This was a book I had bought on a while a couple of years ago and just finally decided to actually read it. Overall I was not super impressed with the book, but the ending now has me deciding if I want to continue the series or not. I found the twist at the end to be quite good and was not really expecting it overall. Plus the way the final couple of chapters were handled was also quite good. Overall, the majority of the book is just a bland fantasy world from the perspective of an accountant for an empire, but then things happen and we find that there is a bit more depth here as well. I like the character as a whole, a tortured soul who wants a chance to free her people, but I just wish the earlier parts had gotten things moving a bit quicker then it did.

7. <b>Goosebumps: Welcome to Dead House</b> by R. L. Stein (4/4/23) - I debated if I would count this as it was a bedtime story to Aydan, but I figured, it is still a book and I may as well count it. Frankly it has probably been nearly 25 years at least since I read this book initially. While I still enjoyed it for what it was, its not as good as I remember probably largely just cause its geared towards the childrens age range. That said, I also feel like they updated some stuff in the book since I read. At one point in the story, the kids are growing thru the graveyard reading the gravestones and some of the deaths are listed as early 2010s I believe, which would have been a far time from a book written in the 90s. Either way, Aydan enjoyed the book and shall likely read others to him in the future as well.

8. <b>Resident Evil: Zero Hour</b> by S. D. Perry (4/6/23) - The final book in the Resident Evil based books went back to the beginning, though as the side to the beginning. The book focuses on the events of Resident Evil 0 which plays out concurrently to Resident Evil 1. All around the story was enjoyable and while I have not fully played this particular game, I am sure it played out quite much like the game in most respects. I sort of got thrown off by this as I was expecting a follow up to the previous novels but it appears the series plays out from the various games and are not a full on universe of books. I only just found this out but still glad I read the series overall. The books themselves are all average at best, but worth the read if you were a fan of the series.

9. <b>Star Wars: Thrawn Ascendancy</b> by Timothy Zahn (5/2/23) - The next book in this trilogy I believe. Second book continues with Thrawns impressive streak at being a genius in the military but being completly inept in the political realm. All around this was another great read and is from probably my favorite of all of the Star Wars authors. Not to mention, this is easily my favorite character in all the series as well. There is not much to say here, as its standard Star Wars with some intrigue going on with the character buildings as we are largely living inside of the Unknown Regions of the Chiss Acendency.

10. <b>The Way of Kings</b> by Brandon Sanderson (7/16/23) - This one was a nice and very long read as can be seen since my last completion. This took me quite a bit to get into, the first section of the book was a lot of character building and world building and it was slow to get started. Around the middle though I was hooked and especially towards the end I didnt want to stop reading. I much look forward to continuing the story in the next book even if they take me two months to complete again. The basis of the story is a rising evil that is coming and all the events that is building up to it. Kaladin and Shallan are probably the two most interesting of the characters, but Dalinar and everyone else is still quite good once they get rolling.
