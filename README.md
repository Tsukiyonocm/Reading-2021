### Non-Fiction
1. <b>Digital Minimalism</b> by Cal Newport (1-9-24) - Overall this wasn't quite what I was hoping for. I am not sure what I was looking for to be honest, but this was basically just a book on not spending so much time on social media largely. The book did slightly go over spending time on other websites and just in general not spending much time on your phone, but otherwise it didn't add much I had not already read elsewhere. I think I was looking more into things that can be done to help minimalism in general, sort of like scanning physical images and storing digitally, or storing digital paperwork type of things. Sadly not quite what was received.

### Fiction
1. <b>Diabolique</b> by John Paul Fitch (12-16-23) - Ultimately I was not overly impressed with this book. This is basically a book of horror short stories with various themes. Most of the stories had some intriguing parts but overall fell flat to me. Some of the monsters seemed interesting in themselves, but as mentioned the rest of the story just fell apart for me personally cause I found it hard to follow the primary storyteller. Overall, dont regret reading it, but its not something I could recommend and would likely not read again.

2. <b>The Memory Police</b> by Yoko Ogawa (1-13-24) - This was a suprise and I found it somewhat enjoyable though quite different then anything I have probably read before. The basic premise is that the main character and the people who live on this island (somewhere around Japan), live a perfectly normal every day existence. The largest difference is that every now and again things disappears. What this means is that, say while you are sleeping, as this always seems to happen overnight, picture frames disappear. When you wake up in the morning, something feels off about your head, you see these things on your dresser but have no idea what they are. Eventually you realize they were things to hold pictures in but have no idea what they are called. Then you are required to remove them all from your house and dispose of them and never have them again. This is enforce by a sort of Nazi like storm trooper type unit call Memory Police. All around a fun read.

3. <b>Sojourn</b> by R. A. Salvatore (1-29-23) - I believe I wrote it in the previous thoughts on these books, this series is just stunning and so glad I am re-reading it all these years later. This one takes Drizzt out of the Underdark and into the over world as he starts on the journey that he is well known for. Spectacular story, great characters and just the write mix of wit and emotion mixed in. Again the monologues of Drizzt are just spectacular and some of the best bits of the overall story. Frankly I feel I could write this for almost every book in the series that I have at least personally read.

4. <b>Star Wars: Queens Shadow</b> by E. K. Johnston (2-14-24) - This book took place in the interim periods of episode 1 and episode 2. The story starts largely on Amidala's last couple of days of being queen and goes into the first year or so of being a senator for Naboo. Overall was interesting to see the interactions between the various senators and her. For a story that largely did not have much going on with it, I still found it interesting to read as it filled in the world a bit more.
