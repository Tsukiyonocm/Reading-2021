### Non-Fiction
1. <b>Japans Infamous Unit 731</b> by Hal Gold (12-16-22) - This was more inline with what I was hoping the book on the Nazi doctors I read last year was. This went more into what was done, more about the particular experiments and had a lot more first hand accounts for people who partook or witnessed some of the experiments. I still believe that the Nazi doctors appear to be more cruel, but frankly thats because their work just largely seemed to have no pertinence to actual science and the japanese work at least was science, albeit just very brutal and unethical to the extreme. Overall, WW2 seems like a very dark period in regards to medicine and human ethics.

2. <b>The Planets</b> by Andrew Cohen and Professor Bryan Cox (1-21-23) - This has been something I have been reading at bed time with Aydan for the better part of the last year or so, we just finally finished it. Overall the book was quite informative, going over the creation of the solar system and the planets, going into detail about each of the planets and their place in the system and how things got to be where they are today. Talking about how little we still know about the outer planets of Uranus and Neptune and how we have not been back to them since the Voyager probes of the 70s or 80s. A lot of facts, a lot of things to remember, and spaced over a very long time, but was worth the read for sure. Not something I will likely ever read again though, but I dont regret the reading for a moment.

3. <b>Humankind</b> by Rutger Bregman (2-2-23) - This was a fantastic read. I personally have always felt that I believed that humans are by default selfish. I always loved hearing about those people that do good things. Feel good stories for me get into the heart strings very easily, but I also felt this was a rarity more then the norm. After reading this book, I believe I may be mistaken, that people are not inherently garbage and that there is good in the whole. I also find it interesting that the final chapter of this book goes over the Christmas Truce from World War 1, which is actually the topic of the next book I am going to read. I also am reminded of a passage from the final Expanse book. In which Holden is talking about how humanity is capable of terrible things, but that in the end, the good things we do outnumber the bad, even if just a little. I hope that this is the world that we live in, and I shall try to keep this mindset in the future more and change my way of thinking and maybe interactions with others.

### Fiction
1. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - The Rising Star</b> by Cavan Scott (12-14-22) - This has been a surprisingly good story arc so far I think. The series seems to do some things different then other book series in the sense that a large portion of the book seems to take place over a couple of hours of time. This is in contrast where many other stories just seems to pass on for months at a time. In this case the main part of the story follows another of the "Great Works" to bring unity to the republic, in this case its a great fair. Naturally this doesn't go to plan and things get interrupted by the Nihil. That with the more human feeling Jedi in the story arc as a whole has me interested in following up. I might even have to pay full price for the rest of the stories.

2. <b>Patron Tales</b> by Russell Smeaton  (12-16-22) - This was a mixed bag of stories which is a mixture of dark fantasy and just plain odd. Probably my favorite story was the Etch-a-sketch story which just seemed quite cool honestly. A bit of a mystery and a pleasant ending that was not quite what I would have suspected. Another story called "Sandcastle" seems like the prologue to a dark Narnia story or something. Seems to me it could have leapt into a much larger world. Overall, the stories were mixed with various frogs, chickens, and a bunch (or one?) cat!

3. <b>The Expanse: Memories Legion</b> by James S. A. Corey (1/9/23) - Finishing the series out by reading the book that contains all the short stories that was written thru the run of the main series. Filling in some of the back stories of Amos, Erich, and Solomon Epstein among many others. Was a fantastic read and the final story was sort of a nice ending to the series. I really hope they fill in the universe again at some point, but I believe this may be it. Honestly do not regret reading a single story in this series as a whole.

4. <b>The Witcher: Baptism of Fire</b> by Andrzej Sapkowski (2/13/23) - Overall this sort of felt like it was more of a filler episode of a show more so then the main story. It seems to be setting up the narrative for the future books as it didnt really delve to much outside of setting up a few events and have a lot of character development. We get a bit of what happened to Yennefer, Geralt and Ciri after the events of the last book and the battle at the magic island, but we dont really learn much more then that, especially with Ciri. It was still interesting getting to know some more characters, I just wish there would have a been a bit more meat to the story.
