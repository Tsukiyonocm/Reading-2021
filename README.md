### Non-Fiction
1. <b>Japans Infamous Unit 731</b> by Hal Gold (12-16-22) - This was more inline with what I was hoping the book on the Nazi doctors I read last year was. This went more into what was done, more about the particular experiments and had a lot more first hand accounts for people who partook or witnessed some of the experiments. I still believe that the Nazi doctors appear to be more cruel, but frankly thats because their work just largely seemed to have no pertinence to actual science and the japanese work at least was science, albeit just very brutal and unethical to the extreme. Overall, WW2 seems like a very dark period in regards to medicine and human ethics.

### Fiction
1. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - The Rising Star</b> by Cavan Scott (12-14-22) - This has been a surprisingly good story arc so far I think. The series seems to do some things different then other book series in the sense that a large portion of the book seems to take place over a couple of hours of time. This is in contrast where many other stories just seems to pass on for months at a time. In this case the main part of the story follows another of the "Great Works" to bring unity to the republic, in this case its a great fair. Naturally this doesn't go to plan and things get interrupted by the Nihil. That with the more human feeling Jedi in the story arc as a whole has me interested in following up. I might even have to pay full price for the rest of the stories.

2. <b>Patron Tales</b> by Russell Smeaton  (12-16-22) - This was a mixed bag of stories which is a mixture of dark fantasy and just plain odd. Probably my favorite story was the Etch-a-sketch story which just seemed quite cool honestly. A bit of a mystery and a pleasant ending that was not quite what I would have suspected. Another story called "Sandcastle" seems like the prologue to a dark Narnia story or something. Seems to me it could have leapt into a much larger world. Overall, the stories were mixed with various frogs, chickens, and a bunch (or one?) cat!
