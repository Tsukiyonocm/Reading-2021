### Non-Fiction
1. <b>Japans Infamous Unit 731</b> by Hal Gold (12-16-22) - This was more inline with what I was hoping the book on the Nazi doctors I read last year was. This went more into what was done, more about the particular experiments and had a lot more first hand accounts for people who partook or witnessed some of the experiments. I still believe that the Nazi doctors appear to be more cruel, but frankly thats because their work just largely seemed to have no pertinence to actual science and the japanese work at least was science, albeit just very brutal and unethical to the extreme. Overall, WW2 seems like a very dark period in regards to medicine and human ethics.

2. <b>The Planets</b> by Andrew Cohen and Professor Bryan Cox (1-21-23) - This has been something I have been reading at bed time with Aydan for the better part of the last year or so, we just finally finished it. Overall the book was quite informative, going over the creation of the solar system and the planets, going into detail about each of the planets and their place in the system and how things got to be where they are today. Talking about how little we still know about the outer planets of Uranus and Neptune and how we have not been back to them since the Voyager probes of the 70s or 80s. A lot of facts, a lot of things to remember, and spaced over a very long time, but was worth the read for sure. Not something I will likely ever read again though, but I dont regret the reading for a moment.

3. <b>Humankind</b> by Rutger Bregman (2-2-23) - This was a fantastic read. I personally have always felt that I believed that humans are by default selfish. I always loved hearing about those people that do good things. Feel good stories for me get into the heart strings very easily, but I also felt this was a rarity more then the norm. After reading this book, I believe I may be mistaken, that people are not inherently garbage and that there is good in the whole. I also find it interesting that the final chapter of this book goes over the Christmas Truce from World War 1, which is actually the topic of the next book I am going to read. I also am reminded of a passage from the final Expanse book. In which Holden is talking about how humanity is capable of terrible things, but that in the end, the good things we do outnumber the bad, even if just a little. I hope that this is the world that we live in, and I shall try to keep this mindset in the future more and change my way of thinking and maybe interactions with others.

4. <b>The True Story of the Christmas Truce</b> by Anthony Richards (2/19/22) - So I had been planning on reading about this event since I listened to the song by Sabbaton, The Christmas Truce. Then the last book I read prior to this also went into the events that transpired back in WW1. Frankly it was as its written, a large portion of the armies in this particular area of France decided to take off the days of and sometimes much later than Christmas 1914. Usually this was put into place because they wanted to celebrate and spent time burying those who had died on the days and weeks prior in no mans land, but sometimes this continued because everyone felt the need to not ruin a good thing. Often times things would end and go back to war as usual once the next regiment got shifted in. All around a quite impressive feat to have happened in the middle of wartime.

5. <b>The Minimalist Home</b> by Joshua Becker (3/23/23) - So this is just simple book about owning less about the authors best ideas for tackling your whole house. Ultimately I read this because the topic interest me and I find myself at least moving this way for the future. Not to say I am going to go down to 30 belongings or anything, but I have been trying to overall buy less and get rid of some of the stuff I owned myself anyway. Overall the book was informative, though nothing revolutionary if you have read on the topic in the past.

6. <b>The Vanishing Face of Gaia</b> by James Lovelock (4-21-22) - So the main premise of the book and James Lovelock in general is the Gaia Theory, to my understanding, the theory stands that the earth itself is capable of controlling its own climate as a human body does to keep it in homeostasis for life. Like a human being getting sick though, eventually so much can be dumped into it that you catch a cold. The world adjust to this as much as it can, but eventually it becomes to much and much of its life force can be killed off and a new normal begins. This particular book I was interested in because he is a big proponent of nuclear energy which I perosnally am not to familiar with the pros and cons of it. He is not so much a fan of the other renewables though such as wind, solar (except solar thermal), and hydro. The main complaint is that those are sort of a using a bandaid to heal a gunshot wound, they do little more then offer platitudes and really dont solve the problem at large. Was a fascinating book for sure, though I feel this quote is probably the most interesting: <br>
<i>"In fifty years in the whole worldwide nuclear industry no more than one hundred have died. Compare this with the tens of thousands who died in the coal and oil industries and the hundreds of thousands who died in making renewable energy or from the consequences of using it. Yes, hydroelectricity is “renewable,” but who notices how dangerous it is until a dam bursts?"</i>

7. <b>This is not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality</b> by Peter Pomerantsev (5/19/23) - This was another book where it was not exactly what I was expecting, but was another happy read. Well happy in the sense that I found it interesting anyway of a read. Overall the book focused a lot on the Russian troll farms where they are hired specifically to push an agenda throughout the website. If the Kremlin wanted to push for a particular policy or to push for a specific outcome of confusion or discord, they would flood the internet and various news sites comment boards with comments in order to push a divide. He talked a bit also about the good the internet has had in regards to allowing people to being able to find like minded individuals to create a movement for change. Then like in black mirror talks about how that same thing has been used to put despots in power, murder countless innocent and overall just pushing people to act as a mob. Overall a scary look into the future, but a hopeful one somewhat to hope that this will pass.

8. <b>The March of Folly</b> by Barbara Tuchman (8-8-23) - This took me way to long to read, while the content was a bit interesting, I just couldnt get into it much. The basics of it is that the blunders of history, from the popes the popes that lead to the fall of Rome up to Vietnam have all been largely created by people who should have known better and still proceeded anyway. In many cases, the leaders of the US in Vietnam and the leaders of Britain during the revolutionary war knew where their choices were leading their respective countries. In each time, those in power for one reason or another chose to stay the course and kept doing the wrong things for all the wrong reasons once they committed themselves. Overall, interesting book, just not what I was hoping to get out of it I guess.

9. <b>How We Will Live on Mars</b> by Stephen Petranek (9-27-23) - I have been wanting to read this since I watched the Mars mockumentary several years ago. The show largely follows in a documentary format what would happen with the first colonist on mars. The perilous journey they would take to get there, setting up the first habitats, hurdles to overcome to grow food and maintain oxygen and much more. Overall this was a nice introductory which gives you an idea of what it would be like to head to Mars. Overall this skims the surface of a lot of details, and the book has aged a bit since some of the information they story talks about is now longer relevant. All around though this was an entertaining read.

10. <b>Brain Rules</b> by John Medina (10-5-23) - This was a fascinating read. While there was so much here to really delve into, one of the most interesting things it talked about was how the brain even has an adult as parts of it which is seemingly as young and maleable as when a baby. What I mean by this is that they can grow new neural connections and largely learn new things. So you can basically teach an old dog new tricks. The book went in depth on things that can happen when various areas of the brain are damaged, how information is not stored in a seemingly way that makes sense and that there are certain parts of the brain that will light up when you see the letter A, and different areas will light up when you see the letter Z. All around quite fascinating.

11. <b>Auschwitz</b> by Miklos Nyiszali (10-16-23) - As interesting as a read as this was, it was also quite heart wrenching at times listening to the author talk about his experiences. This guy during the last year of the war a prisoner sent to the camp but had worked as a doctor on the camp largely working with corpses and performing autopsies on them for Dr. Mengele. The first instance is after a bit of satisfactory work he was granted the chance to check the actual part of the camp where the women were at to find his wife and daughter. After searching around through various barracks he was able to find them. Only for a few months later to find out that their barracks is about to be liquidated and he tries to get them out of the camp to a work camp on the next train to give them a chance at living. The other part that comes to mind is the Sonderkommando (prisoner workers) who found a 15 year old girl alive underneath a pile of corpses after being put thru the gas chambers. He was able to revive her in this unprecedented situation, only after pleading for her life to have her then shot in the back of the head and killed anyway a few hours later.

12. <b>Insight Meditation: The Practice of Freedom</b> by Joseph Goldstein (11-20-22) - All around I got what I thought from this book. It was informative and did a lot to push towards the benefits of meditation and was rather insightful at times. The last section of the book was probably the most interesting as it sort of delved into the methods used to achieve this more so then the theory behind it. In particular there is a part in a chapter about compassion which I found quite interesting. <br />
*"There are always two parts in any interaction. One part is to learn how to speak effectively, and the other is to learn how to listen effectively. Remembering to listen seems especially important in times of difficult communication, when there is tension and conflict. Other people always have their own point of view. If we want to truly connect with and understand others, we must also listen."*

### Fiction
1. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - The Rising Storm</b> by Cavan Scott (12-14-22) - This has been a surprisingly good story arc so far I think. The series seems to do some things different then other book series in the sense that a large portion of the book seems to take place over a couple of hours of time. This is in contrast where many other stories just seems to pass on for months at a time. In this case the main part of the story follows another of the "Great Works" to bring unity to the republic, in this case its a great fair. Naturally this doesn't go to plan and things get interrupted by the Nihil. That with the more human feeling Jedi in the story arc as a whole has me interested in following up. I might even have to pay full price for the rest of the stories.

2. <b>Patron Tales</b> by Russell Smeaton  (12-16-22) - This was a mixed bag of stories which is a mixture of dark fantasy and just plain odd. Probably my favorite story was the Etch-a-sketch story which just seemed quite cool honestly. A bit of a mystery and a pleasant ending that was not quite what I would have suspected. Another story called "Sandcastle" seems like the prologue to a dark Narnia story or something. Seems to me it could have leapt into a much larger world. Overall, the stories were mixed with various frogs, chickens, and a bunch (or one?) cat!

3. <b>The Expanse: Memories Legion</b> by James S. A. Corey (1/9/23) - Finishing the series out by reading the book that contains all the short stories that was written thru the run of the main series. Filling in some of the back stories of Amos, Erich, and Solomon Epstein among many others. Was a fantastic read and the final story was sort of a nice ending to the series. I really hope they fill in the universe again at some point, but I believe this may be it. Honestly do not regret reading a single story in this series as a whole.

4. <b>The Witcher: Baptism of Fire</b> by Andrzej Sapkowski (2/13/23) - Overall this sort of felt like it was more of a filler episode of a show more so then the main story. It seems to be setting up the narrative for the future books as it didnt really delve to much outside of setting up a few events and have a lot of character development. We get a bit of what happened to Yennefer, Geralt and Ciri after the events of the last book and the battle at the magic island, but we dont really learn much more then that, especially with Ciri. It was still interesting getting to know some more characters, I just wish there would have a been a bit more meat to the story.

5. <b>Recursion</b> by Blake Crouch (2/21/23) - Blake Crouch is easily becoming one of my favorite authors. Everything I have read by him has been pure gold, and this is no exception. Think of a chair that can take you back to any memory largely of your choice, you could go back in time and relive your life starting from a particular moment full memories intact and change events that you did not like in your life. The downside is, once you get back to the moment in time you choose to go back in time, everyone now has a second set of memories of this previous life as well as the memories of the current life. So if you died in the first life but were saved in the second, you now have the memories of dying. Wash rinse repeat and abuse and you have the basis for this story. Fantastic.

6. <b>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</b> by Seth Dickinson (3/24/23) - This was a book I had bought on a while a couple of years ago and just finally decided to actually read it. Overall I was not super impressed with the book, but the ending now has me deciding if I want to continue the series or not. I found the twist at the end to be quite good and was not really expecting it overall. Plus the way the final couple of chapters were handled was also quite good. Overall, the majority of the book is just a bland fantasy world from the perspective of an accountant for an empire, but then things happen and we find that there is a bit more depth here as well. I like the character as a whole, a tortured soul who wants a chance to free her people, but I just wish the earlier parts had gotten things moving a bit quicker then it did.

7. <b>Goosebumps: Welcome to Dead House</b> by R. L. Stein (4/4/23) - I debated if I would count this as it was a bedtime story to Aydan, but I figured, it is still a book and I may as well count it. Frankly it has probably been nearly 25 years at least since I read this book initially. While I still enjoyed it for what it was, its not as good as I remember probably largely just cause its geared towards the childrens age range. That said, I also feel like they updated some stuff in the book since I read. At one point in the story, the kids are growing thru the graveyard reading the gravestones and some of the deaths are listed as early 2010s I believe, which would have been a far time from a book written in the 90s. Either way, Aydan enjoyed the book and shall likely read others to him in the future as well.

8. <b>Resident Evil: Zero Hour</b> by S. D. Perry (4/6/23) - The final book in the Resident Evil based books went back to the beginning, though as the side to the beginning. The book focuses on the events of Resident Evil 0 which plays out concurrently to Resident Evil 1. All around the story was enjoyable and while I have not fully played this particular game, I am sure it played out quite much like the game in most respects. I sort of got thrown off by this as I was expecting a follow up to the previous novels but it appears the series plays out from the various games and are not a full on universe of books. I only just found this out but still glad I read the series overall. The books themselves are all average at best, but worth the read if you were a fan of the series.

9. <b>Star Wars: Thrawn Ascendancy</b> by Timothy Zahn (5/2/23) - The next book in this trilogy I believe. Second book continues with Thrawns impressive streak at being a genius in the military but being completly inept in the political realm. All around this was another great read and is from probably my favorite of all of the Star Wars authors. Not to mention, this is easily my favorite character in all the series as well. There is not much to say here, as its standard Star Wars with some intrigue going on with the character buildings as we are largely living inside of the Unknown Regions of the Chiss Acendency.

10. <b>The Way of Kings</b> by Brandon Sanderson (7/16/23) - This one was a nice and very long read as can be seen since my last completion. This took me quite a bit to get into, the first section of the book was a lot of character building and world building and it was slow to get started. Around the middle though I was hooked and especially towards the end I didnt want to stop reading. I much look forward to continuing the story in the next book even if they take me two months to complete again. The basis of the story is a rising evil that is coming and all the events that is building up to it. Kaladin and Shallan are probably the two most interesting of the characters, but Dalinar and everyone else is still quite good once they get rolling.

11. <b>Wayward Pines - Pines</b> by Blake Crouch (7/29/23) - As has come to be expected, this was a fantastic read and went to places I was not expecting. Blake Crouch is easily becoming one of my favorite authors. This story basically a guy waking up in the woods without his memory and finding himself in a town. From there the memories come back and everything goes bizarre. Overall a fantastic read which can be attested in that it took me less than two weeks to read it.

12. <b>Star Wars: Queens Peril</b> by E. K. Johnston (8-7-23) - This was actually a bit interesting, a few of the chapters was a bit too much detail for me, but overall it fit the narrative I just didn't think it added anything to me. The story takes place for the weeks and months from the time Amidala was elected queen until the end of the events of The Phantom Menace. It did not go to much in-depth into what was already seen in the movies, but it did dig a bit more into the thoughts of the people involved and was an interesting take overall. Not likely something I would read again, but also don't regret reading it.

13. <b>Goosebumps: Hall of Horrors - Why I Quit Zombie School</b> by R. L. Stein (8-7-23) - I had never read this before so at least this time it was a new story. Simple story overall with a standard twist from Stein at the end, plus the every chapter ending in a cliff hanger. Pretty decent overall and I still remember why I liked these books as a kid.

14. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - A Test of Courage</b> by Justina Ireland (8-20-23) - This was actually a young adult book I had bought a long time ago and finally decided to sit down and start reading this series in the proper reading order. The book introduces a few new Jedi to the mix, namely Vernestra and Imri. The basics of the story starts with them leaving on a space ship to head to the Starlight Beacon (which I read in the last book I had read out of order). Calamity happens and the jedi a few other survivors and droid are forced to survive and fight to escape the Nihil. Overall was a decent read, and even though it was for a young age group it did not feel like a little kids book which was nice.

15. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - Out of the Shadows</b> by Justina Ireland (9-4-23) - This was a convenient next book as it utilized the characters from the previous story I had just finished. That said, this was a normal novel in the series and not a shorter story of kids. The story takes place with Vernestra and Imri being syphoned from the frontlines and being sent to do what amounts to a stand around and see roll on a survey vessel of an area. Mixing in a few more characters with Jordanna and Syl, rounding out the none jedi and leading the story on its course. Overall was quite good and enjoyable. From this point on I am also going to try to read this series in order, even if that means I got to spend full price for the books!

16. <b>The Hollow Ones</b> by Chuck Hogan and Guillermo Del Toro (9-27-23) - I really wasnt expecting much from this book. I largely read it because I enjoyed The Strain which was written by the same authors, plus I like Del Toros works in general. This is a largely supernatural story like the other which is a slow burn. Tells the story from a couple of perspectives over history and the primary story is from perspective of Odessa Lockwood. She is an FBI agent who gets wrapped up in all this after having to shoot her partner at a crime scene. The Blackwood character reminds me a lot of Van Helsing a bit, but overall, this was a pretty interesting story and something I will for sure watch for the sequel to come out.

17. <b>Exile</b> by R. A. Salvatore (10-28-23) - Book 2 of the dark elf series and one of the best series of fantasy books I have read. Ive enjoyed this series since I first read it all the way back in high school. This continues the story Drizzt and his adventures through the Underdark. This is actually the prequel series to his introduction to the realm and the characters that have become a mainstay. Overall not much to say about this, love the book and love the series. Do yourself a favor and read it!

18. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - The Fallen Star</> by Claudia Gray (11-6-23) - This was the next book in The High Republic series of Star Wars books. Was another solid entry as well into the series. This has us facing off still against the Nihil threat as well as the various other oddities that come aboard the Starlight Beacon. All around this was a fairly self contained story which actually does not showcase a lot of different locations having been almost completly isolated to Starlight Beacon. All around its a good story which sets up some character deaths, some characters struggles and also showing that the threat is real. All around, enjoying this series of books so far.

19. <b>Star Wars: Tempest Runner</b> by Cavan Scott (11-23-23) - This was not quite what I was expecting when I first picked it up to read. First off, the "book" is written sort of like a screenplay, which makes sense since this was first written for an audio book format, but I always just assumed that it would be re-written in a standard book form for the release. Second, this was actually pretty decent and gave us a deep dive into the mind and life of what is actually one of the villains in the High Republic series of books so far. This book actually takes place prior to the book I finished right before this, but is completely unrelated largely to any of the other books in the sense that we follow Lourna Dee from when she is captured to how this book ends. All around an enjoyable read and really like the depth this gives to this anti-hero.
