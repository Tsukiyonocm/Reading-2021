### Non-Fiction
1. <b>Digital Minimalism</b> by Cal Newport (1-9-24) - Overall this wasn't quite what I was hoping for. I am not sure what I was looking for to be honest, but this was basically just a book on not spending so much time on social media largely. The book did slightly go over spending time on other websites and just in general not spending much time on your phone, but otherwise it didn't add much I had not already read elsewhere. I think I was looking more into things that can be done to help minimalism in general, sort of like scanning physical images and storing digitally, or storing digital paperwork type of things. Sadly not quite what was received.

2. <b>AI 2041: Ten Visions of Our Future</b> by Kai-fu Lee and Chen Qiufan (3-12-24) - So this was a mixed bag of what I thought I was going to get and what I got. I had assumed this would be more of a deep dive into AI but sadly the book largly skimmed the surface of it. That said, I still found it enjoyable to read and it told me a lot of things on the horizon that I was not familiar with. The book covered AI teaching, driving, UBI, AI happiness, AI bring about plenitude and much more. Overall the Plentitude chapters and AI Teaching was probably the most interesting. The AI teaching is either seperate or in addition to a live teacher where the class content is customized for the student based on their strengths, weakness and what they are interested in. Plenitude is about the coming where AI is able to drive down the costs of commodities down to near zero because of the ease of manufacture and the lower cost in general for everything. Overall the book made everything seem all shiney and new and while I doubt it will go as smoothly as portrayed, I sure hope it keeps this course either way.

3. <b>Get Well Soon: History's Worst Plagues and the Heroes Who Faught Them</b> by Jennifer Wright (3-19-24) - This was an interesting read. It basically looked at some of the worst plagues from history. Some of which it went into was Polio, Small Pox, Bubonic Plague and Leprosy among others. Overall the book did not go much indepth of any of these diseases as a whole, but it did dive into how the populace and leadership in some cases reacted to the outbreaks, as well as how those infected were treated as well. There is a wide range of how people were treated throughout history among which those with Leprosy on Hawaii for instance were removed from the populace and isolated alone on an island. This island eventually become home to hundres of lepors over time and spoke about how a priest came over to eventually treat these people as humans again. Overall was a good read for an introduction to the various diseases, but by no means is the reading extensive.

4. <b>The Anatomy of Fascism</b> by Robert O. Paxton (5-16-24) - Overall this was an interesting read. It largely went into the history of Fascism, or more precisly the ideas that orginated the ideas anyway. It also delved into the failed experiements on where fascism failed to take hold and the thoughts on why it succeded where it did. It also went into how it could still happen today as the ideas it was based upon have not really gone away, though the likelyhood of this managing to garner the same level of success as it did in the 1930's is not likely to happen. The book was not the most interesting of reads honestly, this was more of a education book more so then it was a good tale being told, but it was intersting to see a side that is not often portrayed. I thing for thought is that its not the despot that creates fascism in a society but a set of factors that lead that society to get to that point. If at the end of the day the leader is just a terrible person, you might have a dictatorship, but that does not mean they are fascist.

5. <b>How to Clone a Mammoth</b> by Beth Shapiro (6-13-24) - This was a fascinating read and its right in my wheel house of interests that I dont read enough about, Gene Editing. The book has a hook right at the beginning, she tells you that they will never clone the mammoth. Then they proceed to tell you about the science and how they will go about cloning a simulacrum of the mammoth. The basics of the story is that because of the degradation that happens to DNA over time and especially after anything dies, there is just not enough DNA to fully put together a 100% accurate mammoth. That said, they could in fact use the strands they have and insert that into another elephant and create a likeness of the mammoth. Or even using gene slicing to create new strands of DNA that make another species of elephant have properties of what made a mammoth a mammoth. Highly recommend this book and fantastic look into the world of gene editing and de extinction.


### Fiction
1. <b>Diabolique</b> by John Paul Fitch (12-16-23) - Ultimately I was not overly impressed with this book. This is basically a book of horror short stories with various themes. Most of the stories had some intriguing parts but overall fell flat to me. Some of the monsters seemed interesting in themselves, but as mentioned the rest of the story just fell apart for me personally cause I found it hard to follow the primary storyteller. Overall, dont regret reading it, but its not something I could recommend and would likely not read again.

2. <b>The Memory Police</b> by Yoko Ogawa (1-13-24) - This was a suprise and I found it somewhat enjoyable though quite different then anything I have probably read before. The basic premise is that the main character and the people who live on this island (somewhere around Japan), live a perfectly normal every day existence. The largest difference is that every now and again things disappears. What this means is that, say while you are sleeping, as this always seems to happen overnight, picture frames disappear. When you wake up in the morning, something feels off about your head, you see these things on your dresser but have no idea what they are. Eventually you realize they were things to hold pictures in but have no idea what they are called. Then you are required to remove them all from your house and dispose of them and never have them again. This is enforce by a sort of Nazi like storm trooper type unit call Memory Police. All around a fun read.

3. <b>Sojourn</b> by R. A. Salvatore (1-29-23) - I believe I wrote it in the previous thoughts on these books, this series is just stunning and so glad I am re-reading it all these years later. This one takes Drizzt out of the Underdark and into the over world as he starts on the journey that he is well known for. Spectacular story, great characters and just the write mix of wit and emotion mixed in. Again the monologues of Drizzt are just spectacular and some of the best bits of the overall story. Frankly I feel I could write this for almost every book in the series that I have at least personally read.

4. <b>Star Wars: Queens Shadow</b> by E. K. Johnston (2-14-24) - This book took place in the interim periods of episode 1 and episode 2. The story starts largely on Amidala's last couple of days of being queen and goes into the first year or so of being a senator for Naboo. Overall was interesting to see the interactions between the various senators and her. For a story that largely did not have much going on with it, I still found it interesting to read as it filled in the world a bit more.

5. <b>Star Wars: The High Republic - Midnight Horizon</b> (3-24-24) - So this story actually takes place concurrently with the last High Republic story I read called "The Fallen Star". This story though takes place on Corellia where there is a Nihil plot being uncovered. In the course of events the story is unwound and we have to see things from the perspectives of the Jedi who are on Corellia and can feel the events going on back on Starlight Beacon where their friends are dying. All around was a pretty decent read, was sort of interesting seeing things play out from a different perspective and them having to contend with their feelings and wanting to run immedietly to try to save their friends back on the station. 

6. <b>Upgrade</b> by Blake Crouch (4-12-24) - Overall this was a good story. It was not as good as Dark Matter or Recursion, but it was enjoyable. My main complaint was that it took about 2/3rds of the book to get moving and the conclusion was basically the last like 50 pages of it. The pacing just seemed a bit off. That said, the basis of the story was quite nice and it covered a topic that I have an interest in even if that some of things that happen arent exactly likely to happen in the world any time soon. The basics of the story is that because of a very bad event in years passed, genetic editing is banned and illegal. Naturally something is introduced which converts the primary players into what amounts to almost a super hero, though not in the sense of marval or DC anyway. Well worth the read overall, just not on par with the aforementioned books

7. <b>A Thousand Pieces of You</b> by Claudia Gray (5-1-24) - Overall this story was a bit predictable but the characters and the settings were written well enough that I didnt care much. I enjoyed the story quite a bit. Do I like it enough to complete the series? I am not sure yet, but I do not regret reading the story. Overall the story is fairly basic, the main characters father gets murdered in the beginning, main character and the family friend decide to use the parents tech to go thru other dimensions to capture the killer and get revenge. OVerall thats about the extent of it. The settings all felt different but the same at the same time and like I said, I enjoyed the story for what it was. This author has a way of capturing my attention with liking the characters and just enjoying the overal story.
