## Books read starting December 1st 2024

### Non-Fiction

1. <b>Mengele: Unmasking the Angel of Death</b> by David G. Marwell (12-24-24) - The author of the book was actually involved with 
the hunt for Josef Mengele back in the 80's when they were trying to figure out if he was dead or not. Overall the book is broken 
into two parts, the first part is about the early history up to and including World War 2. This part is quite interesting going 
into his academic achievements prior to joining the army. You read about how he did end up joining the war and was a glorified 
medic in the army for many years before his connections was able to get him into the head position at Auschwitz. Here the book 
is quick to point out that some of the worst things said about Mengele is largely fairy tale in the sense that there is no verifiable 
evidence that some of them happened. That said, there does look to be ample evidence into his work with twins and verifying 
what happened to them as they both died at same time. The second half of the book focuses on his run from Germany and life 
in South America while in hiding and ultmately the search for him and trying to prove his death. Overall, the book was fascinating
 though the chapters that details the events after what ultimately happened after his death was a bit slow and not as interesting. 
 That said, the final chapter talking about the first and probably only meeting between Josef and his son Rolf. Here we see that 
 Josef was unrepentant and refused to see how everything he did was a bad thing. Lastly, just how someone was able to coldly look 
 thru the groups of people and see not a person, but without any emotion choose thousands for immediate death.

### Fiction
1. <b>Beren and Luthien</b> by J. R. R. Tolkien (1-4-25) - I enjoyed revisiting the world of the Lord of the Rings, but I did not really
enjoy reading this story. So the story was broken up into chapters and each chapter was a slightly different retelling of the same
original story. So you basically read the story in the same fashion about 8 times during the course of the book. One of these retelling 
was in a poem form which I also was not expecting to read about a 100 page long poem. I had been expecting this to be written in the
same fashion as the Lord of The Rings, but alas I was disappointed with this. Overall the tale wasn't bad, I did enjoy the first telling
of it, I just wish the rest of the book would have been a continous story, and not just the variations of the story that the author
wrote in his life.
