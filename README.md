1. <b>The Living Dead</b> by George Romero and Daniel Kraus (12-19-21) - This was an overall interesting reading experience. The first couple of chapters of this book had me completely deja vu'ed, is that even a word? It had me to the point I had to go back through the last couple of years and order history to make sure I had not already read the book before. After this though, the book diverged and it appears to be a new story I hadn't read before. The story starts off going through different characters and various situations when the zombie apocalypse begins. From here we get to the end of the story where the revelation is quite intriguing if not a little contrived and sort of thrown out there out of the blue. While I agree with the moral here, I think it could have been weeded in the story a bit more, but overall the story was quite good and worth reading.
